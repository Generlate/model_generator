## Directions  
- Create a virtual environment with the dependencies installed
- Download the repository (unzip if you downloaded the zipped file)
- navigate to model_generator/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model.py
- open in zsh/bash and run 'python3 machine_learning_model.py'
- this should generate a box in a file titled "generated_box.off"
- this box can be viewed on websites like https://3dviewer.net/
- in model_generator/Datasets/AustensBoxes/ you can find the training and testing datasets. These are filled with boxes, generated from a simpler, box generating algorithm.

## Dependencies
- Python3
- Pytorch
- Numpy

# Features To Come  
* More supported file types (.obj, .usd, .fbx)
* Faster generation speeds
* Plugin to Omniverse UI
* Generate more than just boxes
* Text as input
* Neural network improvements
* Easier execution
