Generlate is a tool that makes building generation easier for property developers and designers.

---

## The Plan  
The plan for Generlate is to create an innovative tool that will automate the majority of processes included in modern building design. 

# Main Features To Come  
* ML image generator
* ML model generator
* Trait optomizer
* Object recognition
* Metaverse Integration
* Export to common architecture file types: .ai, .ps, .3dm, .dwg, etc.
* Integrated libraries to replace field experts
* visual scripting

# Short Term Goals  
Roadmap at [Generlate.com](generlate.com)  

We would like to have a proof of concept by 2023. This will probably include a basic ML algorithm, which can produce 3d models.
