EelBlue is a generative tool for architecture design, on windows. 

__Getting Started__
Visual Studio 2019 is recommended, EelBlue is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.
1. Downloading the repository
start by cloning the repository with 

__The Plan__
The plan for EelBlue is to create an innovative tool that will automate the majority of processes included in modern building design. Development of the application is published on Youtube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQFeRy_NDvUsA0VmuJNBUYQ

__Main Features To Come__
* ML image generator
* ML model generator
* Trait optomizer
* Object recognition
* Metaverse Integration
* Export to common architecture file types: .ai, .ps, .3dm, .dwg, etc.
* Integrated libraries to replace field experts
* visual scripting

__Short Term Goals__
Roadmap at 
We would like to have a proof of concept by 2023. This will probably include a basic ML algorithm, which can produce editable models.
